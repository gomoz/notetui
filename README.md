# NoteTUI

A keyboard-driven terminal application (TUI) for daily markdown notes.

## What is NoteTUI?

NoteTUI is a terminal-based note-taking application that lets you write daily notes in markdown format. Each day gets its own file, and you can easily navigate between days using keyboard shortcuts.

### Features

- **Daily notes** - Automatic filename based on date (`DD-Mmm-YYYY.md`)
- **Markdown editor** - Syntax highlighting and line numbering
- **Fuzzy search** - Search across all notes with `Ctrl+F`
- **Calendar view** - Visual navigation between dates
- **Todo list** - Collects all `##` headings from your notes
- **Keyboard-driven** - Fast navigation without mouse
- **Norwegian language** - Dates and weekdays in Norwegian
- **Auto-save** - Notes are saved automatically when navigating
